  -- ========== INTERNAL SUBSCRIPTION DETAILS ==========

  -- The internal user associated with the subscription.

  -- We want the latitude to correct mistakes in the future. (Hopefully this doesn't bite me later.)
  -- **** NB/NOTE: THIS COLUMN WAS RENAMED TO `user_token` and made NON NULLABLE. ****

  -- The stripe IDs (nullable in case we can't associate or if we use paypal)

  -- You can safely assume object IDs we generate will never exceed 255 characters,
  -- but you should be able to handle IDs of up to that length. If for example you’re using MySQL,
  -- you should store IDs in a VARCHAR(255) COLLATE utf8_bin column (the COLLATE configuration ensures
  -- case-sensitivity in lookups).
