  -- example of the model. Like album art or a user profile picture / avatar.
  maybe_cover_image_media_file_token VARCHAR(32) DEFAULT NULL,

  -- OPTIONAL. Only for TTS and Voice Conversion models.
  -- The full IETF BCP47 language tag (eg. en, en-US, es-419, ja-JP, pt, etc.)
  -- (Not that it matters apart from categorization, since voice conversion is universal.)
  -- NB: There's another set of tables (model_weights_extension_voice_conversion_details, etc.) that

  -- and then make this one authoritative.
  maybe_ietf_language_tag VARCHAR(64) DEFAULT NULL,

  -- OPTIONAL. Only for TTS and Voice Conversion models.
  -- The IETF BCP47 language tag's primary language subtag (eg. "es-419" becomes "es")

  -- ========== BUCKET STORAGE ==========

  -- The hash for the bucket directory that contains the original upload
  -- as well as any associated other files.

  -- ========== MODERATION DETAILS ==========

  -- Mods may have to approve of vc models for them to show up in a public index.
  -- Models can be used by the author (or other parties that know the URL) before

  -- ========== MIGRATION DETAILS ==========

  -- A cache of the total number of times the model has been used.
